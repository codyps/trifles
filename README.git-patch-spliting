git rebase -i
# mark patch to split as 'e'
git reset -p HEAD^
# select ("y") patch pieces that will go in _later_ patches.
# pieces marked "n" will stay in the original patch.
# XXX: this provides the only way I've found to reset the working tree _without_ reseting HEAD
git commit --amend
# ^ update original patch to be smaller

# ---*---:
git add -p
# select pieces "y" to add to the next patch (logic is "normal" now)
git commit -m "bleh"
# go back to "---*---" and repeat as needed.
