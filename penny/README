= Penny =
Nicer things in C, for cheep.

Includes useful non-specific macros and data structures for use within C
based projects.

Quite a few of these depend on ccan libs, and use of ccan is intended (which is why I don't have a linked list or container_of()).

== Parts ==

penny.h::
	Includes general items that do not warrent their own header. These
	include the following:

	- barrier
	- htonll() & ntohll()
	- ACCESS_ONCE()
	- LINE_STR
	- likely(), unlikely()
	- CAT2(), CAT3()
	- FIELD_SIZE(), typeof_field()

	- GCC_VERSION_GREATER(a,b,c)

math.h::
	Commonly used math operators

	- MAX(), MIN() (and variants with more arguments)
	- ABS()
	- KILO(), MEGA()
	- SAT_CEIL(x, ceil) - constrain 'x' to 'ceil' and return.
	- pow4(x) - calculate '4^(x)' using integer operators.
	- SUB_SAT(x, y) - calculate 'x - y' and return 0 if the result would
	                  be negative.
	- DIV_OR_ZERO()
	- DIV_ROUND_UP()

mem.h::
	Some handy compaions to the common str*() functions that operate on
	lenth specified byte arrays instead of null terminated arrays.

check.h::
	Some functions for compile time checking of code.

circ_buf.h::
	Macros for managing a circular buffer.

darray.h::
	Macros for managing a dynamic array where the array metadata and
	data sections are contained within the same allocation.
	Using ccan's darray may be a better choice.

gen_fn.h::
	Contains a macro which generates a bsearch on a particular type,
	given a particular comparator.
