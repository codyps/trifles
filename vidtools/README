google photos has a per-file upload limit
	10GiB?

Note:
	max_muxing_queue_size
		if any source files have non-fixed PTS (ie: their frame rate is
		not fixed), when encoding to mp4 (which requires fixed frame
		rate) many frames will be duplicated. max_muxing_queue_size
		must be >= the max number of frames to be duplicated.	

		With v4l2 sources (capture cards) this can happen if the
		tape/cable/rf/etc source drops out and results in the signal to
		the capture card being stopped, causing it to cease to emit
		frames for some period of time. More often, the source will not
		emit a signal when starting up, and as a result a large number
		of dups are present at the start of a video.
