play 2 sync:

	# 16.183 is the difference in start times to sync up
	# note that mpv's `--start` is relative to it's output (ie: after it starts rendering, it seeks to that point)
	 mpv vhs_4_b.mkv --lavfi-complex='movie=vhs_4.mkv:seek_point=16.183,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS,bwdif [vid2]; [vid1]bwdif[vo1]; [vid2][vo1] hstack [vo]'

	 mpv --lavfi-complex='[vid1]bwdif[vo0];[vid2]setpts=PTS-30.497/TB,bwdif[vo1]; [vo0][vo1]hstack[vo]' vhs_4_d.mkv --external-file=vhs_4_b.mkv

	 mpv --lavfi-complex='[vid1]setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB,scale=1440:trunc(1440/dar/2)*2[vo1]; [vo1][vid2]hstack[vo]' vhs_1_bwdif_bm3d.0_clip_0.mkv --external-file vhs_1_bwdif_bm3d.0_clip_0_2p_medium.mp4

play 2 with external file:

	mpv  --lavfi-complex='[vid1] bwdif [vid0a]; [vid2] bwdif [vid1a]; [vid0a][vid1a]hstack[vo]' vhs_1_nlstrong0_clip_0.mkv --external-file=../vhs_nl/vhs_1_nlonly0_clip_0.mkv

google photos has a per-file upload limit
	10GiB?

Note:
	max_muxing_queue_size
		if any source files have non-fixed PTS (ie: their frame rate is
		not fixed), when encoding to mp4 (which requires fixed frame
		rate) many frames will be duplicated. max_muxing_queue_size
		must be >= the max number of frames to be duplicated.	

		With v4l2 sources (capture cards) this can happen if the
		tape/cable/rf/etc source drops out and results in the signal to
		the capture card being stopped, causing it to cease to emit
		frames for some period of time. More often, the source will not
		emit a signal when starting up, and as a result a large number
		of dups are present at the start of a video.


https://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/V4L_capturing
	uses gstreamer to syncronize audio & video.
	claims that ffmpeg can't/doesn't handle that natively
	unclear if that is still true

ffmpeg option force_key_frame 0 is noted as helping video/audio sync issues

_appears_ that sync in my setup (capture-vcr, direct use of ffmpeg for alsa and v4l2) works without issues.

gopro convert jpegs to timelapse lossless
	ffmpeg -f image2 -start_number XXXXX -framerate 30
	-pattern_type sequence -i 'G%07d.JPG' -c:v timelapse.mkv


# show color space info

	ffprobe -v error -show_streams raw.mp4 | grep color_


# ON COLOR MUXING:

Try using `-strict unofficial` to get ffmpeg to pass through the color info
