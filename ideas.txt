* command line driven torrent metadata editor.
  'torrentinfo' - command line metadata viewer in python.
  http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification
    describes format and gives links to code to read it.
  bencoding:
    byte strings: <strlen in ascii base 10>:<strdata>
    lists: l<items>e
    int: i<int ascii base 10>e
    dict: d<bencoded str><bencoded elem>e
  editing in vim possible, with careful keystrokes.
  added 'tracker_modify.pl', which does what I need.

* webdav fuse fs without the need for root perms.
  i'm unsure the reason, but it appears that davfs2 has decided it would be
  jolly good idea to need root perms for mounting a network fs. with fuse.
  Current fuse davfs projects:
  * 'davfs2' - needs root perms, expects the use of mount.
  * 'wdfs' - last release 2007
      fails to mount rutgers sakai "reasources" webdav. Complains that it
      could not be mounted due to internal server error (500). Possibly an
      issue with neon. Compare it's use of neon with cadaver (a realy nice
      almost usable command line client, just needs some fixes to tab
      completion).
  * 'fusedav' - last release 2006, not in gentoo repo.
  wdfs & fusedav use 'neon' to interface with the webdav protocol.
  I might be calling this up without cause, lacking new releases is not
  nesicarilly a sign of bad software. Some testing is in order.
  -- Fixed wdfs in my branch on github. It wasn't setting its useragent.
     and somehow that broke it, though it isn't clear why.

* Decent note taking.
	* gpg encryption
	* all stored as plain text (or retrevable as such)
	* versioning (now it seems like I should write a front end on git to
	  impliment this
  'note' writen in perl, supports encryption.
  	* cmdline options not documented (as far as I could see)
	* interactive thing not too fun (i'd prefer `note add [note name]` or
	  some such
	* defualts to binary storage, no 'show' command visible (can edit and
	  save somewhere else
