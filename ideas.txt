* command line driven torrent metadata editor.
  'torrentinfo' - command line metadata viewer in python.
  http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification
    describes format and gives links to code to read it.
  bencoding:
    byte strings: <strlen in ascii base 10>:<strdata>
    lists: l<items>e
    int: i<int ascii base 10>e
    dict: d<bencoded str><bencoded elem>e
  editing in vim possible, with careful keystrokes.

* webdav fuse fs without the need for root perms.
  i'm unsure the reason, but it appears that davfs2 has decided it would be
  jolly good idea to need root perms for mounting a network fs. with fuse.
  Current fuse davfs projects:
  * 'davfs2' - needs root perms, expects the use of mount.
  * 'wdfs' - last release 2007
  * 'fusedav' - last release 2006
  wdfs & fusedav use 'neon' to interface with the webdav protocol.
  I might be calling this up without cause, lacking new releases is not
  nesicarilly a sign of bad software. Some testing is in order
