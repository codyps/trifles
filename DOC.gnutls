Q:
	gnutls_dtls_prestate_set(sess, prestate);

	- how long do we need to keep prestate around?
	- can we free/reuse it after the handshake occurs?
	- can we free/reuse it after this set_prestate() call?
A:
	prestate is only used in the gnutls_dtls_prestate_set() call itself.
	What you do with prestate after that call is entirely up to you.
