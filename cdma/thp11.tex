\section{Problem 1}

\subsection{a}
SR output if $x_0 = 0$ will continually be 0 as the XOR of 0 and 0 is 0.

\subsection{b}
The state of SR after 31 shifts given an $x_0 = 7ffffff$ is $0x38000004$. This is verified via \texttt{./p1 0x7ffffff 31 31}

\subsection{c}
It is periodic. The period is 0x7fffffe, meaning that given a time $t$, $x_{t+0x7fffffe} = x{t}$.

\subsection{d}
This is verified via \texttt{./p1 0x7ffffff -1 -1}. Note that this takes longer to run than it should.
The output is \texttt{7ffffffe: 7ffffff -> 1
	match
}
