- pcb
 - track clearance
  - allow different settings for angle and straigh
  - allow setting on a arbitrary track basis (not only per netclass)

 - make selecting items easier
  - thin lines need to be "graby"
  - overlayed elements should pay attention to which element has their
    silkscreen/pads under the mouse.
  - give some indication when a particular element is selected (highlight it)

 - get rid of the pop up warning for zones when zones are hidden
 - show the autoroute options in all modes (wire, select, and zone)

 - allow changing the width of layed/placed tracks
 - support autowidening of tracks
 - alignment targets
  - midpoints, 0.1 pin offsets
 - support internal connections in parts
 - add a better autorouter
 - auto placer
 - command line to add elements
 - allow specification of interchangeable connections
  - for example, pins on a crystal could be connected either way.
  - more complicated, could have interchangable connections between modules
   - for example, if our design has more multple xor gates embedded in a
     single chip, and uses multiple chips

  - appears to be a level of abstraction above the schematic.
  - but we want this to be decided at routing time.
