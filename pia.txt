# Network Namespaces

https://github.com/chrisbouchard/namespaced-wireguard-vpn

 - No support in systemd-networkd directly
 - Have to configure interfaces directly (shell scripts)

1. start wg (in normal)
2. move wg interface to netns
3. start transmission in netns
4. ?? forward local non-netns connections into netns to allow transmission-remote to work
	use 


# seperate routing tables based on fwmark

 - This _seems_ like we can use systemd-networkd to initialize wg interface.
 - Care must be taken to pick the right packets to fwmark, iow: must avoid the
   transmission-remote related ones

1. mark packets that are transmission related with a fwmark
2. add a ip rule to have them use a different routing table
3. have that routing table use the wg interface
