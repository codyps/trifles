 - Serial port on HW C1 is a 4 pin connector near a 2x5 connector.
 - Pin 1 is 3.3v [unconfirmed], 2 = Rx/Recieve, 3 = Tx/Transmit, 4 = GND

TEG-S80g H/W:V2.0R (8 port gigabit switch by Trendnet):
   rtl8370 switch
   Can't find a data sheet online anywhere
   rtl8367 drivers appear to include some code for talking to it.
   There appears to be an i2c chip attached to it, I assume the function is
   very similar to existing RTL switches: load a bunch of data on boot from
   the i2c chip, then listen to i2c commands.

   "api_8370" references smi_write() and smi_read(), making it a bit unclear
   what the actual interface is. (IF "EMBEDDED", "setReg()" and getReg() are
   used.

   i2c rom = ATMLH142 (TSSOP/SOIC)
   690BG regulator? (Q1)
