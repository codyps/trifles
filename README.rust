Wanted:

 - a way to have type aliases inside trait impls when the higher trait doesn't provide them
	ie:

	struct Encoder<W, B, C> {
		foo: W,
		bar: B,
		baz: C,
	}

	impl<W, B, C> serialize::Encoder for Encoder<W, B, C> {
		type S = Encoder<W, B, C>; // WANTED: this is currently forbidden


		// Primarily helps avoid lots of typing
		// And lots of changes when a new <> arg is added.
	}
