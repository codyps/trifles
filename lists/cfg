shell scripts
	great for programs written in shell
	In accessable for anything else
	Potentially slow
	Not really programmatically editable (too flexible)

lua
	similar drawbacks as shell scripts, but faster

general programming language (extention of lua and shell scripts)
	example: write C, build shared libs for each
	config issues (for compilable langs): need compilation, reloading
		config is hard.

liblcfg
	http://liblcfg.carnivore.it/
	C API
	Programatically editable?

json
	see lists/cmdline-datastore
	cmdline tools to read/edit exist but aren't in distros
	Not very expressive (no conditional syntax, must generate cfg)

ini
	lack of smdline tools
	not nestable
