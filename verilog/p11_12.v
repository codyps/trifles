/* 11: Develope a small set of test patterns that will (1) test a half-adder
 * circuit, (2) test a full-adder circuit, (3) exahausively test a 4-bit ripple
 * carry adder, and (4) test a 16 bit ripple carry adder by verifying that the
 * conectivity between the 4-bit slices are connected correctly, given that the
 * 4-bit slices themselves have been verified
 */

/* 12: Develop and exercise a testbench (including a test plan) to verify a
 * gate level model of an S-R (set-reset) latch
 */

/* For problem 11 & 12, please develop the verilog code for a 4 bit ripple
 * carry adder first and verify it by simulation. Then develop the rest of the
 * code to answer question 11 and 12
