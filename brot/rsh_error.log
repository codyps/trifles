Timeout in waiting for processes to exit, 2 left.  This may be due to a defective
rsh program (Some versions of Kerberos rsh have been observed to have this
problem).
This is not a problem with P4 or MPICH but a problem with the operating
environment.  For many applications, this problem will only slow down
process termination.
